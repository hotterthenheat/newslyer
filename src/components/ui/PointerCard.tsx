  SLAYER TERMINAL - THE POINTER CARD (components/ui/PointerCard.tsx)

  The Building page's hover card, made one piece so
  every surface can wear it the same way (Noah,
  2026-09-12, on the book ladder: "use the same
  method for the translucent hover card you did for
  the building page… right now they do not function
  the same"): small, translucent glass, beside the
  pointer and moving WITH it, never in its way,
  flipping to the pointer's other side at the right
  edge and riding up when it would run off the
  bottom; a head (the strike in silver, its part, a
  word at the right) over a two-column grid of
  label · value with a small sub. Portalled to
  <body> so a transformed ancestor never traps it.

  ONE MOUNTED ELEMENT PER HOVER — the card's fade-in
  runs once, when it appears; a host that remounted
  it on every pointer move (a component defined
  inside the host's render) restarted the fade sixty
  times a second and the card never got past a third
  of its opacity (Noah, 2026-09-12: "it lacks
  smoothness… gets stuck and glitches/spazzes out").
  `PointerFollowCard` is the host-proof shape: the
  host names where the pointer WAS when the card
  appeared, and the card tracks the pointer itself
  from there, so the host never re-renders on a move.
