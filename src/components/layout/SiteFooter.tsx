==================================================
  SLAYER TERMINAL - SITE FOOTER
  The landing page's footer, extracted so it ends
  EVERY main page (Noah, 2026-08-23) — AppShell
  renders it under the routed content; the landing
  and the products' pages keep their own copies.

  ONE PIECE, HIS PARTNER'S PICTURES (2026-10-03 —
  Noah, with his partner's footer: the whole footer
  one screen, the terminal caught in the dark, a
  picture a page, still until a hand is on it; then
  2026-10-07: "for the footers my partner actually
  wants the other ones and not the actual look of the
  website"). The footer is FooterArt's screen, and the
  picture on it is one of his partner's drawn scenes
  (footer/scenes.ts, picked by the address in
  footer/registry.ts) — Pulse's desk, Terrain's strike
  field, Trace's tape, the Dossier's map, the book's
  walls, Compass's cards, the Weigher's curve, Paper's
  orders, the backtest's scrubber, the Journal's month,
  and on the landing every product at once, moving. The
  page's own still broken into pixels — our first cut —
  is gone at his word. Half the height his first one had
  (his: "the footers are a bit big"): the words and the
  three stacks of links on the left, the picture beside
  them as tall as they are, one status line at the
  foot. The words stay crisp: the fringe is the
  picture's, not the links'.

  `home` changes only the link plumbing, never the
  look: on the landing, #pricing/#faq are in-page
  anchors and every door into the terminal plays the
  launch gate; in the terminal they route back to the
  landing's sections and the doors are plain
  navigations. A product's own page (/products/*) is
  outside the terminal too, so its doors play the
  gate; its anchors route home.
