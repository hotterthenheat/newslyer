/*
==================================================
  SLAYER TERMINAL - EXPOSURE LEDGER
  Strike × expiry in the house capsules, one greek
  at a time or all five side by side — the grid
  Skylit is known for, in the house's own cells
  (Noah, 2026-09-03: "dates with the ability to only
  show vex, dex, or gex individually or all 3 side
  by side… the king node stands out" — 09-04: the
  house word is SUPREME, "king" is theirs; 09-09:
  "the 'all' is only dex, vex, gex. not vanna and
  charm" — All is the five now, and a cell too
  narrow for "-$272.1M" prints "-272M", or the
  colour alone).

  CAPSULES, FULL (Noah, 2026-09-05, closing the
  redesign arc — terrain, reach, wheel, wind map,
  hexbin, honeycomb: "i feel like im trying too hard
  to recreate the wheel. lets revert back to capsules
  just make our capsules nice and full"):
    · the rows share the panel's whole height — no
      dead surface under the grid (fullscreen used to
      fill a third of the screen); each capsule fills
      its cell, and the figure inside scales with the
      row (9–13px); more rows than fit scroll
    · every cell is a HeatPill on the house ramp
      (ember amplifies, glacier absorbs, the dark
      zero), sized against the whole surface's scale
      so a far expiry's quiet cells read quiet next
      to today's loud ones
    · HOVER lights the capsule (silver ring) with a
      quiet wash along its row and down its column,
      and ONE FIXED READ LINE above the grid carries
      strike · date · put · call · net · OI · the
      verdict — no card under the pointer (the thing
      Noah would not have back); a click PINS it
      (the ring stays, the strike label goes silver),
      clicking empty space lets go
    · the SUPREME — the heaviest STRIKE of the whole book, the chart's
      magenta — wears the magenta tag on its row and the ring on the date
      carrying most of it; the heaviest single CELL wears a plain star
      (2026-09-08: the two had shared one word and named different strikes);
      spot runs through the rows as a rule
