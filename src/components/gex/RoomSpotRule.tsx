  SLAYER TERMINAL - THE SPOT ROW'S PILL, ON THE
  ROOM'S PRICE (components/gex/RoomSpotRule.tsx)

  One price on the page (the owner, 2026-10-14):
  the pill between the strikes reads the room's
  price now (pages/pinpoint/useRoomScan.ts
  useRoomSpot) — the head's figure — and it alone
  re-renders on the tick; the grid round it moves
  only when the price crosses a strike.
