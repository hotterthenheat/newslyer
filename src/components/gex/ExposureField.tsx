  SLAYER TERMINAL - EXPOSURE FIELD
  The exposure matrix's successor — the head the grid
  never had, over the Ledger:

    the head    whose book (with a search to change
                it), the SUPREME as a magenta door
                that pins its strike, fullscreen;
                beneath, GREEK (GEX · DEX · VEX ·
                All), EXPIRIES, STRIKES each side
    the Ledger  ExposureLedger — strike × expiry in
                the house capsules, full: the rows
                share the height, the figure in every
                cell, a fixed read line, hover lights
                the capsule, click pins

  HISTORY, so nobody rebuilds it by accident: the
  redesign arc of 2026-09-03…05 tried a flat SVG
  field, a three.js terrain, the Reach (each expiry
  as a curve at its σ·√T width), the WHEEL (spot at
  the hub, strikes as rings, expiries as rays — "this
  is the one", then removed whole when Noah's
  partners did not approve), a wind map on Plot's
  vector mark, Observable's hexbin on Plot's hexbin
  transform, and a stretched honeycomb with the
  figures inside. Noah closed the arc on 2026-09-05:
  "i feel like im trying too hard to recreate the
  wheel. lets revert back to capsules just make our
  capsules nice and full." The capsules are the view.

  THE BOOK IS BUILT WHOLE (±30) over the calendar and
  the window is a view of it — the presets set it,
  the field scrolls it. Hover any cell for every
  figure at that strike and expiry.
