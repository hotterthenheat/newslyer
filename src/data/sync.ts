/*
  SLAYER TERMINAL - THE STORES' SYNC (data/sync.ts)

  Noah (2026-10-10): "build the first one" — a paying member's desk layouts, watchlist, journal and preferences lived
  only in the browser they used. Now the account carries them: every store the terminal keeps in localStorage under a
  carried key is mirrored to the account's own rows (public.user_state, one row a key, the value as the browser kept
  it), and follows the person between machines.

  HOW, without touching thirty stores: the stores write localStorage as they always did. This module watches the
  browser's own setItem/removeItem for the carried keys, stamps each change, and uploads it a breath later, batched.
  At boot, before any store reads its key, the account's rows are pulled and the newer side wins, key by key — a row
  newer than the local stamp is written into localStorage; a local value the account has never seen is uploaded (so
  the machine's state becomes the account's at the first sign-in). A fresh sign-in on a page already running pulls the
  same way and reloads once if anything landed, since the stores had already read their keys. Signing out flushes
  what is pending, then clears the carried keys from this browser: a shared machine starts the next person clean, and
  the account brings everything back at the next sign-in.

  What is carried: a person's work (the watchlist, positions, the Pulse desks, Terrain's layout and named layouts and
  drawings, the Weigher's desk, the paper accounts, journal and desk, the review journal and its tags, closed trades,
  tracked setups, Trace's watchers, alert names, flow reasons, the 0DTE and screener settings, the ledger's names,
  news follows, the room) and the Settings preferences (theme, candles, the ruler, the desk's own rows, a few column
  choices). NOT carried: scripts — they live in IndexedDB and get their own seam later; the profile, which the row
  already mirrors; and device things (the rail's fold, dock widths, tab leases, an owner's view-as).

  Last write wins by time. Offline, the upload waits for the next change or the next boot; nothing is lost locally.
