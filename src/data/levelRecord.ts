  SLAYER TERMINAL - HOW THE LEVELS HELD, SESSION BY SESSION
  (data/levelRecord.ts)

  THE BASE RATES (the competitive audit, 2026-10-13:
  no product in the category publishes auditable
  accuracy for its levels — "none of us publishes
  auditable accuracy statistics"; the Map's report
  grades today, this grades the sessions on hand).
  For every past session the market keeps, the
  levels AS THEY STOOD AT ITS OPEN — read off the
  first book kept that session, never off a later
  one (no look-ahead) — and what the session then
  did to them: tested or not, held its first test or
  broke it, broke at all; and whether the close
  landed inside one expected move of the open.

  The record is read, not stored: the house keeps a
  few sessions of bars and a book a bar; the feed
  keeps the sessions the vendor serves. A machine
  that reads the vendor's two years will grade two
  years. The rule for a test and a break is the
  report's own (levelTicks), moved here so the two
  cannot drift.
