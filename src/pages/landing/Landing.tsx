==================================================
  SLAYER TERMINAL - LANDING (/) · v3

  Rebuilt 2026-09-19 after Noah turned the first
  rebuild down ("the tools we have arent even
  showcased… i meant more like a smooth transition…")
  and sent the sites that stand out to him, then: "i
  dont want randomly generated renders, i want the
  REAL thing from our website so it doesnt scream
  fake". What the very first page was is in
  docs/landing-page-reference.md.

  THE IDEA. There is ONE picture on this page and it
  is the terminal itself, in a window (TerminalWindow),
  wide under the headline, then docked beside the
  words while the page walks it through every tool
  (Tour). Nothing on the page is drawn to look like
  the product. It RAN in the window until the same
  evening; Noah then made it STILLS ("keep our
  interactive visuals but then make them static. i
  dont like the idea of people flickering through the
  website without any purchases. a static image breeds
  mystery and desire") — photographs of the real
  pages.

  IT MOVES AGAIN, SINCE 2026-10-01 — as FILMS. Noah,
  of his partner's landing: "he has actual recordings
  of the page working which is exactly what we were
  missing … i like the first section of the page
  showcasing all the tools instead of big words". And
  then: "replace the big window with the wall,
  recordings in the tour too, and remove the 4 small
  windows". So the first screen is THE WALL (Wall.tsx):
  all eight tools, each playing a film of itself in
  use; the tour's window plays the film of every page
  it names; and "In every room" with its four small
  windows is gone. The films are OURS, made from this
  terminal by scripts/make-landing-clips.mjs — never
  his: "we have smoother animations when switching
  pages". His type sizes, logo and palette are not
  taken ("we will keep that from ours").

  THE LOOK, from his references: very large light
  type with one marked word; every head in two tones;
  a small word over a short rule above it; features
  as rows on hairlines, not boxes; pill buttons; a
  bar that lifts into a floating pill; a lot of air.

  THE GROUND (ground.tsx) opens on the visitor's own
  theme, turns slowly into the other half way down
  the tour — the terminal in the window turns with
  it — and turns home again after the last tool. The
  page ENDS ON THE THEME IT BEGAN ON: the prices, the
  questions and the footer stand on the visitor's
  own ground.

  THE RULES IT KEEPS (memory: no-public-grades,
  plain-english-rule, landing-page-v2):
  · NO grade, score or performance claim of ours.
  · Plain English. Not a single buzzword.
  · NO REFUNDS is said KINDLY, IN THE QUESTIONS — not
    as a headline over the prices (Noah, 2026-09-19:
    "should be stated in the legal or questions
    section in a kind manner not a big bold section").
    The doors into the terminal stay until checkout
    and sign-in exist (his call, the same evening).
  · The window says its data is simulated. The page
    says nothing about a feed's speed or source.
  · Phones first: the paid traffic arrives from X.
  · The prices are data/billing.ts's. WHAT EACH PLAN
    HOLDS below is Noah's to re-decide.

   A line marked `soon` is sold with the plan but not open yet, and says so: Community is one room behind
   the terminal's "coming soon" wall (Noah, 2026-09-19: it goes on the second plan, marked).
   PRACTICE IS ON THE SECOND PLAN (Noah, 2026-09-20, of what was then Review: "review is in compass").
   THE PLANS ARE BOOK · DESK · SEAT (2026-10-02; they were Pinpoint, Compass, Lifetime — data/billing.ts says why).
   THREE PLANS AGAIN, 2026-10-05: BOOK $75 (then $80, 2026-10-10) · TAPE $120 · DESK $180, the Seat off the page (Noah: "i still want there to
   be 3 plans … our top plan being 180 that includes compass") — Trace goes up to Tape with Dossier, Practice and the
   scripts; Compass, the Weigher and Community are Desk's. Each plan answers one question (data/billing.ts).

   ONE LIST, TWO READINGS (2026-10-01). Every line any plan holds is written ONCE, with the plans that hold it. The
   plan's card reads it as "everything in the plan before, and what this one adds"; the plans side by side (below the
   cards — Noah brought the table from his partner's landing) read it whole. So the two can never disagree, and
   re-deciding a plan is changing its letters here. Two lines took the rooms' present names as they were moved here:

/* ---- the pieces ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

/* THE HEADLINE IS OURS (Noah, 2026-09-19). The first one — "Dealers have to hedge. See where." — turned out to sit a breath
   from a competitor's own hero ("Dealers have to hedge… exactly where they'll be forced to"): both were the first line anyone
   would write about this category. So the headline stopped leading with the dealers' obligation. Two of my replacements
   missed ("The options market." · "The market shows its work."); Noah then PICKED this one from four: "Trade what you can
   see." — short and blunt, in a trader's own voice, and true to a terminal that shows and never instructs.

   AND IT DOES NOT SAY "OPTIONS" (Noah, the same day: "we are going to expand to futures and other things so i dont think
   this options focused look is something we should go for"): the hero, the eyebrow, the paragraph and the footer's line speak
   of THE MARKET and of TRADERS. A tool's own words may still say options where that is what the tool reads today.

   THE MARKED WORD. The headline ends on one word in the house's ink — the foil on a dark ground, the galaxy ink on paper
   (2026-09-30) — over a soft bar. Until 2026-10-01 the headline had a second line, "See the levels / flow / book /
   record.", whose last word changed letter by letter; the hero became one line that day (below) and the marked word is
   the headline's own last one, "see."

   ITS BOX IS WIDER THAN ITS LETTERS (Noah, 2026-09-20: the last letter cut off at its right edge). The ink is a background
   clipped to the text, so it is painted only inside the word's own box — and the headline's tight tracking makes that box
   narrower than the glyphs. The padding gives the ink room on both sides; the equal negative margin takes the room back.

   THE FIRST SCREEN SHOWS THE TOOLS (2026-10-01 — Noah, of his partner's landing: "i like the first section of the page
   showcasing all the tools instead of big words", and then: "replace the big window with the wall"). Under the words
   stands THE WALL: all eight tools, each playing a film of itself in use (Wall.tsx).

   THE WORDS' LAYOUT IS THE ONE HE SHOWED (the same day, with a picture of his partner's hero: "top section should look
   more like this than the current layout we have"): the small line, then THE HEADLINE ON ONE LINE across the page, its
   last word marked; under it the paragraph at the left and the one door at the right, on the paragraph's own line. The
   first cut of the wall's hero had put the headline on two lines at the left with the paragraph and the door stacked
   beside it. Ours still: the type, the eyebrow, the inks, the door's words ("what i dont like is his text sizing, or
   logo, or his color pallete we will keep that from ours").

   On a desk both rows of the wall are on the first screen (the wall is only as wide as the height left under the words
   lets two rows stand); on a phone the wall comes straight after the headline and the words follow it. */
