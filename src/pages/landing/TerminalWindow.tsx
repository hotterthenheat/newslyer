  SLAYER TERMINAL - THE TERMINAL, IN A WINDOW
  (pages/landing/TerminalWindow.tsx)

  The picture on the landing page is the terminal
  itself (Noah, 2026-09-19: "i want the REAL thing
  from our website so it doesnt scream fake").

  IT PLAYS, SINCE 2026-10-01. From 2026-09-19 the
  window held STILLS of the real pages. Then Noah
  saw his partner's landing: "he has actual
  recordings of the page working which is exactly
  what we were missing … we will not be taking his
  actual recording but making our own because we
  have smoother animations when switching pages" —
  and: "recordings in the tour too". So every page
  the tour names is FILMED from the real terminal
  (scripts/make-landing-clips.mjs): a dozen seconds
  of the page in use, nothing over it but a pointer.

  THE STILL STAYS UNDER THE FILM. It is the film's
  own first frame and is on screen at once; the film
  fades in over it when it can play, so the window
  is never empty and the two never jump. The still
  is ALL there is for a visitor who asked for less
  motion or to save data, and where a film cannot be
  played. A film plays only while the window is on
  screen and the tab is in front (films.ts).

  ONE FILM AT A TIME. When the tour asks for another
  page the film on screen holds its frame until the
  next can play, then the next fades in over it.
  When the window turns theme on the same page, the
  other theme's film picks up at the second this one
  had reached, so the turn reads as one motion
  changing its ground.

  WHAT STAYED: the window, its bar saying where it
  is and that the data is simulated, the tour's
  words choosing the picture, the window turning
  theme with the page.

  THE PICTURE'S SHAPE IS FIXED (1440 × 1000 on a
  desk): the window takes that shape (Tour.tsx) and
  a picture is never cropped or stretched there. In
  one column the window is a fixed band and the
  picture fills it from its top left, the way a page
  sits in a window that is shorter than it.
