  SLAYER TERMINAL - PULSE, ON ITS OWN PAGE
  (pages/landing/products/PulsePage.tsx)

  The first product page (Noah, 2026-10-02):
  "starting with the pulse section this section
  needs to start off with a slightly more detailed
  explanation throughout the page explaining what
  it does with images, i want only one screen
  recording on this page showcasing the ability to
  drag and move things around and how they plop
  into open spaces or fit their container … also
  how clicking full screen on something brings you
  to that page with the back to pulse button up top
  being shown."

  So: the head and the desk in the window, still;
  a tile up close; THE ONE RECORDING (the film
  maker's `@pulse-arrange`: a tile dragged into an
  open space, one pulled wider, a tile's door and
  Back to Pulse); the list of tiles; the five house
  desks; the door. Every count and name here is the
  terminal's own (pages/workspace/registry.tsx,
  desks.ts) — change them there and here together.

        Pulse is a grid of live tiles. Each tile is one thing from the terminal — the chart, the dealer book across the calendar, the key levels, the news wire, who reports this week — on the terminal’s name or a name of its own,
        with one line under it that says in words what it is showing. You add the tiles you want, drag them where you want them and pull them to the size you want. The desk saves as you go, so it is how you left it when you come
        back.

        A tile holds one instrument and nothing else: the key levels for one name, the news wire, this week’s earnings. Its head carries the name it follows — the terminal’s, or one you give this tile alone — the controls that
        matter for it, the arrow that opens its whole page, and a menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the instrument stands one line in plain words. <em className="not-italic text-textPrimary">QQQ is above the flip at 411.50, where dealer hedging slows moves down. The call wall is 413, the put wall 410.</em> It is
        there so a glance tells you where things stand before you read a number.
