  SLAYER TERMINAL - THE START PAGE (pages/start/Start.tsx)

  Noah (2026-10-03): "i want there to be a nice
  little page when the user launches the website for
  the first time that basically has an image of each
  page and they can decide which page they want to go
  to, a brief description of that page and simple to
  manuever instead of being ploped into the pulse
  page first thing."

  So: inside the terminal, the rail at its left,
  every page of the rail as a card in the rail's own
  order — the page as the film maker photographed it
  (the landing's stills, in both themes), its room,
  its glyph and name, and one plain line — and every
  card a door. The landing's launch door lands here
  every time (pages/landing/pieces.tsx doorTo; his
  word the same night: "make it be the first thing i
  see even right now") unless Settings › The desk ›
  Opens on › Page names another page. Stills, not
  films, until the recordings are re-cut with the
  new mark.
