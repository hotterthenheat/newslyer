==================================================
  SLAYER TERMINAL - PULSE DESKS
  Named, saved layouts for the Pulse desk (Mo,
  2026-08-19: "save a Pulse layout and come back
  to it instead of rebuilding it"). Every desk,
  preset or the reader's own, autosaves its working
  state as you go, and a preset can always be reset
  to its template.

  A NEW STORE (2026-09-30, the desk rebuilt): every
  widget and every preset the old store named is
  gone, so the desks start clean under a new key —
  `slayer_desks_v2`. Nothing is carried from v1: its
  desks pointed at widgets that no longer exist (and
  the terminal is not launched — the only desks in
  it are ours).

  FIVE PRESETS, named for the moment they serve:

    The session   the chart, the book as a matrix,
                  the range to the close, what has
                  alerted — a first visit opens here
    The open      the chart, the book across the
                  calendar, the levels, the wire, who
                  reports
    0DTE          a one-minute chart, today's book,
                  where it closes, the wall in front,
                  the targets
    The close     the chart, where it closes, the
                  range, where the walls are heading
    My book       positions and watchlist, the chain,
                  the setups that fit, the key levels
                  (the paper account and the journal
                  left it on 2026-10-03, at Noah's word)

  An instance carries its own settings (`state`):
  a preset's calendar is the book tile told to open
  on its calendar. (The book has two views, the matrix
  and the calendar; the ladder went at Noah's word,
  2026-09-30.)
